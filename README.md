# K-Means-and-DBSCAN-Clustering

For this project, I will be going into unsupervised machine learning, and implementing two different clustering techniques:

1. K-Means, and
2. DBSCAN

K-Means creates globular clusters and requires the number of clusters to form (k) as a parameter.  DBSCAN clusters data of a particular density together and derives the number of clusters from the data set.
